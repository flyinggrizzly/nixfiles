We are going to produce a revised version of a task or markdown document.

The document to improve is #ARGUMENT. We will call this the Original.

Based on our conversation, produce a revised version of the Original that includes amendments, improvements, or even
ellisions, that **had they been there in the first place**, would have meant that I did not have to step in and guide or
ask you to revise how you got to your final result.

YOU MUST NOT MODIFY THE ORIGINAL.

## Naming the revised document

Append some alpha marker to the document name, indicating it's a later, alternate version.

For example, if the Original were `task_v1.md`, you would call your revision `task_v1a.md`.

If the Original were `task_v1a.md`, your revision would be `task_v1b.md`

etc
