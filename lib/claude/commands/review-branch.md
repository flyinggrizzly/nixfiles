  Your job is to review the code in git branch #ARGUMENT2.

  Provide feedback in a markdown document called "BRANCHNAME_review.md"

  Pay special attention to similarity to code style in the surrounding code, handling or missed edge cases, and testing.

  Avoid #send and #public_send.

  When using Sorbet, make sure there are no type coercions.

  If there are mocks in the tests, flag them up, especially if they are "close" to the system under test.
